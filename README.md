# R0_of_COVID-19
This is a basic calculation and visualization of the R0 of COVID-19 and the Delta Variant. The data includes 10 steps for several other viruses/diseases.

I will add more information to this later.

Warning: The code is probably a lot longer than it needs to be. It's a personal preference and flaw.
